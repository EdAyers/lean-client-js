Javascript library to interface with the server mode of the [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover.github.io/).

This `lean-client-js-browser` package contains the web browser version.  It communicates with an emscripten build of Lean, optionally using webworkers and webassembly.  See [demo.ts](./demo.ts) for an example on how to use it.
