## Javascript interface to the Lean server

[Demo code](./lean-client-js-browser/demo.ts):
```
npm install
npm run bootstrap
npm run compile
npm run demo
```
And go to http://localhost:8080/

You can then also run `npm run node-demo` to see the same code interacting with a locally-installed version of Lean.
